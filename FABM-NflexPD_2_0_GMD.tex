\begin{abstract}
The acclimative response of phytoplankton, which adjusts their nutrient and pigment content in response to changes in ambient light, nutrient levels, and temperature, is an important determinant of observed chlorophyll distributions and biogeochemistry. Acclimative models typically capture this response and its impact on the C:nutrient:Chl ratios of phytoplankton by explicitly resolving the dynamics of these constituents of phytoplankton biomass. The Instantaneous Acclimation (IA) approach only requires resolving the dynamics of a single tracer and calculates the elemental composition assuming instantaneous local equilibrium.  IA can capture the acclimative response without substantial loss of accuracy in both 0D box models and spatially explicit 1D models.  A major draw-back of IA so far has been its inability to maintain mass balance for the elements with unresolved dynamics.  Here we extend the IA model to capture both C and N cycles in a 0D setup, which requires analytical derivation of additional flux terms to account for the temporal changes occurring in cellular N quota, $Q$. We present extensive tests of this model, with regard to the conservation of total C an N, and its behavior in comparison to an otherwise equivalent fully dynamic model, under idealized conditions with variable light and temperature. We also demonstrate a modular implementation of this model in the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Modelling (FABM), which facilitates modelling competition between an arbitrary number of different acclimative phytoplankton types.  The IA variant is $\approx$10\% faster than the fully dynamic variant for 50 phytoplankton groups, but no clear improvement in computation speed is achieved for fewer groups.  In a spatially explicit setup, performance gains for simulating a small number of phytoplankton groups may be possible, but require modifications of the physical-flux calculations to allow for spatial differences in $Q$ between model grid cells.

%INTRODUCTION
\introduction%% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

Elemental stoichiometry and pigment density of phytoplankton exhibit strong variability across environmental conditions, at both the physiological \citep[e.g.,][]{Garcia2016}, and the community level \citep[e.g.,][]{MorenoMartiny2018}. The physiological flexibility is driven by an acclimative re-adjustment of cellular machinery to changes in the availability in nutrients and light, and the fact that the various cellular functions have competing requirements for resources, an example being enzymes, rich in N \citep{Geider2002}, needed for nutrient uptake and photosynthesis. The systematic differences in cellular composition between species may be explained by the typical composition of some species being better or worse suited than that of others for a given resource regime \citep{Arrigo2005,Burson2016}.

The potential relevance of such variability in the cellular composition of phytoplankton for biogeochemical cycles has been recognized decades ago \citet{Redfield1934,Redfield1958}, and evidence have been building ever since \citep{Lenton2007,Bonachela2016,Pahlow2020}.  Accounting for the acclimative capacity of phytoplankton in models is relevant for predicting the response of ecosystems to environmental change \citep{Kwiatkowski2018,Kerimoglu2018} and for model performance \citep{Ayata2013, Kerimoglu2017, Chen2018a}.  It also can endow models with desirable properties, such as improved model portability \citep{Anugerahanti2021}. However, mechanistic acclimative models typically require additional state variables, usually one for chlorophyll and one for each of the resolved nutrients \citep[e.g.,][]{Geider1998, Flynn2003}, but possibly even more \citep{Bonachela2013, Wirtz2016, Inomura2020} \onur{Check again Inomura2020}.

However, additional state variables can increase the computational costs significantly in spatially explicit setups \citep{Fulton2003}, especially for models with multiple phytoplankton groups, that nowadays can contain 100s of groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Dutkiewicz2020}. As a potential remedy to this problem, the `Instantaneous Acclimation' (IA) approach can be used, where the changes in cellular composition are not dynamically tracked, but are assumed to adjust instantaneously to the resource environment. For instance, \citet{Pahlowetal13} described a model where the Chl:C ratio is adjusted to the ambient irradiance level based on a trade-off between a higher CO$_{2}$ fixation rate as a benefit of a higher Chl:C ratio and the additional respiratory costs of synthesizing and maintaining the pigments.  The FlexPTF model \citep{Smith2016} follows an IA approach, where the Chl:C and C:N ratios are adjusted instantaneously to the optimal ratios for balanced growth \citep{Burmaster1979}.  \citet{Ward2017} compared a fully explicit, classical Caperon/Droop model \citep{Caperon1968,Droop1968} to its IA counterpart, and found that across a range of environmental settings, the predictions of the two approaches matched closely in a 0D setup.  \citet{Kerimoglu2021} introduced FABM-NflexPD 1.0, a 1D setup of the FlexPFT model in the Framework of Aquatic Biogeochemical Models \citep[FABM,][]{Bruggeman2014} and showed that the predictions of the IA variant of the model largely matched those of the fully explicit `Dynamic Acclimation' (DA) counterpart, except during the transitions winter -- spring and autumn -- winter.

FABM-NflexPD 1.0 only tracks N, which may be sufficient for some ecological applications, but not for applications that require mass balance for (multiple) nutrients and carbon.  Here we introduce FABM-NflexPD 2.0, which tracks both C and N\@.  We present a detailed description of a C-based version, which is extended to account also for N fluxes resulting from instantaneous changes in cell quotas, such that mass balance is maintained for both C and N\@.  We evaluate the consistency and robustness of the model by means of the following formal tests:
\begin{description}
 \item [T1] assessment of the conservation of C and N in a simplified version of the model in a 0D setup, where temperature and day length are held constant, and light is provided as a sinusoidal function of time of year
 \item [T2a] test of the IA approach in a more realistic setup, where temperature and day length also vary over time, and light attenuation by phytoplankton is accounted for
 \item [T2b] comparison of the fully explicit (DA) and IA model variants
 \item [T3] simulation with multiple phytoplankton groups
 %\item [T4] \onur{done} application of the model in an idealistic 1D setup and assessment of mass conservation \textcolor{red}{\{Onur: this test failed: in 1D, model does not seem to be mass conservative, see Section~\ref{s.resT4}.\}}

%MODEL DESCRIPTION
\section{Model Description}

\markus{Do we need DOM?  Including DOC and DON in the detritus and reducing the rate of hydrolysis by 1/2 yields almost the same results.  So, in 0D including DOM makes no difference.}

FABM-NflexPD 2.0 differs from FABM-NflexPD 1.0 (K21) in two major respects.  (1) The new version maintains mass balance for both C and N, instead of only N\@.  (2) We restrict this version to 0D for simplicity, which allows subsuming the DOM compartment in the detritus compartment, leaving 5 state variables to represent dissolved inorganic C and N (DIC and DIN), phytoplankton C ($\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}$), and detritus C and N ($\text{Det}_{\text{C}}$ and $\text{Det}_{\text{N}}$).  The rates of change of the state variables are
\begin{flalign}
  \label{eq:dic}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \text{DIC}}{\mathrm{d}\, t} &= \underbrace{F_{\text{Det}_{\text{C}}-\text{DIC}}}_{\textrm{Remineralization}} - \underbrace{F_{\text{DIC}-\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}}_{\textrm{Net C uptake}} \\
  \label{eq:sdin}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\,\text{DIN}}{\mathrm{d}\,t} &= \underbrace{F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}}}_{\textrm{Remineralization}} - \underbrace{F_{\text{DIN}-\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}}_{\textrm{Net N uptake}} \\
  \label{eq:sPhyC}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\mathrm{d}\, t} &= F_{\text{DIC}-\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}} - F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}-\text{Det}_{\text{C}}} \\
  \label{eq:sDetC}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \text{Det}_{\text{C}}}{\mathrm{d}\, t} &= F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}-\text{Det}_{\text{C}}} - F_{\text{Det}_{\text{C}}-\text{DIC}} \\
  \label{eq:sDetN}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \text{Det}_{\text{N}}}{\mathrm{d}\, t} &= F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}-\text{Det}_{\text{N}}} - F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}}
\end{flalign}
where $F_{x-y}$ is the flux from $x$ to $y$ and $x$ and $y$ are state variables, except $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Q}
  \text{Phy}_{\text{N}} = \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot Q
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the phytoplankton N quota (N:C ratio).

\subsection{C and N content of Phytoplankton}

In this, C-based, version of the model, only the C content of phytoplankton ($\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}$) is dynamically tracked via Eq.~\eqref{eq:sPhyC}, whereas $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ is defined as a function of $Q$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Q}.  $Q$ is assumed to adjust instantaneously to its optimal value for balanced growth, as determined by nutrient uptake in the protoplast, $\hat{V}_{\text{N}}$, and net photosynthesis in the chloroplast, $\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}$ (Eq.~10 in K21):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Qopt}
 Q = \frac{Q_{0}}{2} \left[1+\sqrt{1+\frac{2}{Q_{0}{({\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}/{\hat{V}_{\text{N}}}+\zeta_{\text{N}} )}}} \right] %\hfill \{\text{IA}\}
\end{equation}
where $Q_{0}$ and $\zeta_{\text{N}}$ are the subsistence N quota, and cost of N uptake, respectively (Table~\ref{T.pars}). The first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sPhyC}, $F_{\text{DIC}-\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}$, represents net phytoplankton growth:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  F_{\text{DIC}-\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}} = \mu \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}
\end{equation}
% This term is used in this updated model version also to track the DIC concentration, which in turn enables tracing the total C in the system.
% Note that representing the C uptake and respiration terms with a lumped term $F_{\text{DIC}-\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dic} is based on the assumption that the respiration terms (see Eq.~7 in K21) are added back to DIC, and would have to be separated if CO2 was explicitly resolved. (M removed this because both C uptake and respiration are CO2 fluxes)
The second term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sPhyC}, $F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}-\text{Det}_{\text{C}}}$, represents the mortality of phytoplankton:
\begin{flalign}
  \label{eq:mortC}
  F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}-\text{Det}_{\text{C}}} &= m_{\text{C}} \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}^2 \\
  \intertext{Its N counterpart is found by multiplication with $Q$:}
  F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}-\text{Det}_{\text{N}}} &= F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}-\text{Det}_{\text{C}}} \cdot Q
\end{flalign}
where $m_{\text{C}}$ [\unit{m^3\ mmolC^{-1}\ d^{-1}}] is the C-based specific mortality rate.
The remineralization fluxes are calculated as first-order reactions:
\begin{flalign}
  \label{eq:remiC}
  F_{\text{Det}_{\text{C}}-\text{DIC}} &= r_{\text{hyd}} \cdot \text{Det}_{\text{C}} \\
  F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}} &= r_{\text{hyd}} \cdot \text{Det}_{\text{N}}
\end{flalign}

%given by the division of N flux from phytoplankton to detritus, $F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}-\text{Det}_{\text{N}}}$ by $Q$

\subsection{Accounting for Phytoplankton N}\label{S:DescFlux}

The flux from DIN to $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ is given by phytoplankton N uptake, $V_{\text{N}}$:
%As in K21, the source term for the nutrients in the DIM pool are described as the remineralization fluxes from the nutrients in dissolved organic form (e.g., DON), $F_{\text{DON}-\text{DIN}}$ (Table 1, K21), minus the fluxes between the DIM (e.g., DIN) and phytoplankton ($F_{\text{DIN}-\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}$):
%$F_{\text{DON}-\text{DIN}}$ is calculated like the $F_{\text{DOC}-\text{DIC}}$ explained above. $F_{\text{DIN}-\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}$ is N uptake by phytoplankton ($V^{\text{N}}$), which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dphyNdt}
  F_{\text{DIN}-\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}} = V_{\text{N}} = F_{\text{DIC -- Phy}_{\text{C}}} \cdot Q = \mu \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot Q
\end{equation}
The rate of change of $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ resulting from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:dic} --~\eqref{eq:sDetN} is the complement of the sum of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:sdin} and~\eqref{eq:sDetN}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phyn_def}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}{\mathrm{d}\,t} = F_{\text{DIN}-\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}} - F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}-\text{Det}_{\text{N}}} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\mathrm{d}\,t} \cdot Q
\end{equation}
However, $Q$ changes over time, which also contributes to the rate of change of $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$.  This becomes clear when we write the rate of change of $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ in terms of the product rule of differentiation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phyn}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}{\mathrm{d}\,t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\,(\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}\cdot Q)}{\mathrm{d}\,t}
  = \frac{\mathrm{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\mathrm{d}\,t} \cdot Q + \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\,Q}{\mathrm{d}\,t}
%  = V_{\text{N}} - F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}-\text{Det}_{\text{C}}}\cdot Q + \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\,Q}{\mathrm{d}\,t}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Thus, the right-most term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:phyn}, $\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}\cdot \mathrm{d}\,Q / \mathrm{d}\, t$, is not accounted for by our system of Eqs.~\eqref{eq:dic} --~\eqref{eq:sDetN} because $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ is not a state variable.  Following \citet{Smith2016}, we subtract it from the differential equation for DIN\@:
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:sdin2}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\text{d}\,\text{DIN}}{\text{d}\, t} &= F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}} - F_{\text{DIN}-\text{Phy}_\text{N}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\, Q}{\mathrm{d}\, t} \\
    &= F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}} - V_{\text{N}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}} \frac{\text{d}\, \text{DIN}}{\text{d}\, t}
      + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d}\, \bar{I}}{\text{d}\, t}
      + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} \frac{\text{d}\, L_{\text{D}}}{\text{d}\, t}
      + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial T} \frac{\text{d}\, T}{\text{d}\, t} \right)
  \end{split}
  \tag{\ref{eq:sdin}a}\\
  \intertext{and reorganizing:}
%intermediate step:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:sdin2.5}
%  \frac{\text{d}\text{DIN}}{\text{d}t} \left( 1+\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}} \right) = F_{\text{DON}-\text{DIN}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \left(V_{\text{N}} +  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d} \bar{I}}{\text{d} t} \right)\\
% \end{equation}
\label{eq:sdin3}
\frac{\text{d}\,\text{DIN}}{\text{d}\,t} &= \frac{\displaystyle F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}} - V_{\text{N}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot
  \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d}\, \bar{I}}{\text{d}\, t}
    + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} \frac{\text{d}\, L_{\text{D}}}{\text{d}\, t}
    + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial T} \frac{\text{d}\, T}{\text{d}\, t} \right)}%
{\displaystyle 1+ \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}}}\tag{\ref{eq:sdin}b}
\end{flalign}
The partial derivatives of $Q$ with respect to DIN, $\bar{I}$, $L_{\text{D}}$ and $T$ are obtained by canonical application of the chain rule, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{S:Sol}.

For the case of multiple phytoplankton functional types (PFTs), Eq.~\ref{eq:sdin3} can be generalized as follows:
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:sdin4}
\frac{\text{d}\,\text{DIN}}{\text{d}\,t} &= \frac{\displaystyle F_{\text{Det}_{\text{N}}-\text{DIN}} -
  \sum_j \left[ V_{\text{N}}^j + \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}^j \cdot
  \left( \frac{\partial Q^j}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d}\, \bar{I}}{\text{d}\, t}
    + \frac{\partial Q^j}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} \frac{\text{d}\, L_{\text{D}}}{\text{d}\, t}
    + \frac{\partial Q^j}{\partial T} \frac{\text{d}\, T}{\text{d}\, t} \right) \right]} %
{\displaystyle 1+ \sum_j \left[ \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}^j\frac{\partial Q^j}{\partial \text{DIN}} \right]} \tag{\ref{eq:sdin}c}
\end{flalign}
Where $j$ indexes the different PFTs simulated.


% Here, $\frac{\text{d} \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\text{d} t} \big\rvert_G$ corresponds to gross growth of phytoplankton C biomass, i.e., $F_{\text{DIC}-\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sPhyC}. Substituting therefore Eq.~\eqref{eq:fdicphyc} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt}:
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:dphyNdt2}
%   \frac{\text{d}\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}{\text{d}t} \bigg\rvert_G= Q \cdot \mu \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} + \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \frac{\text{d} Q}{\text{d} t}
% \end{equation}
% where, assuming balanced growth \citep{Burmaster1979}, i.e., $V_{\text{N}} = Q \cdot \mu$  (K21, Eq.~6) the first term on the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt2} can be replaced with $V_{\text{N}} \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}$, i.e.,
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:dphyNdt3}
%   \frac{\text{d}\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}{\text{d}t} \bigg\rvert_G=  \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \left( V_{\text{N}} + \frac{\text{d} Q}{\text{d} t} \right)
% \end{equation}

% %\onur{In the N-based version, we had (K21, Eq.~5): $F_{DIN-%\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}} = V_{\text{N}} \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}$. i.e., excluding the $%\frac{\text{d} Q}{\text{d} t}$ term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt3}. %As we discussed, this apparent difference %(apparent, because maybe there is a mistake in the notation? Also note that $F_{DIN-\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}$ is not used anywhere, and in the C-based version of the model it is only saved as a diagnostic quantity)
% %doesn't violate the internal consistency of the N-based version, but it would be great if we could explain what this really is. For instance, is this a `real deviation' in model formulations that contributes (among other sources) to quantitative differences in results?}

% According to Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt3}, the N flux between the DIM pool and phytoplankton can be intuitively understood as the sum of uptake due to growth of C biomass, and the change in the N quota. % It should be noted that this cumulative change can become negative. (?)

% Given that the terms $\hat{V}_{\text{N}}$ and $\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}$ required for calculating $Q$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:Qopt}) are respectively functions of DIN (Eq.~16 in K21) and daytime average irradiance, $\bar{I}$ (Eqs.~20--22 in K21), the total time derivative of $Q$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt3} can be computed as the sum of partial derivatives with respect to DIN and $\bar{I}$ using chain rule:
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:dqdt}
%  \frac{\text{d} Q}{\text{d} t} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}} \frac{\text{d} \text{DIN}}{\text{d} t} +  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d} \bar{I}}{\text{d} t}
% \end{equation}
% Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:dqdt} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt3}, and subsequently Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt3} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin}:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:sdin2}
%  \frac{\text{d}\text{DIN}}{\text{d}t} = F_{\text{DON}-\text{DIN}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \left(V_{\text{N}} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}} \frac{\text{d} \text{DIN}}{\text{d} t} +  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d} \bar{I}}{\text{d} t} \right)
% \end{equation}
% and reorganizing:
% %intermediate step:
% % \begin{equation}\label{eq:sdin2.5}
% %  \frac{\text{d}\text{DIN}}{\text{d}t} \left( 1+\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}} \right) = F_{\text{DON}-\text{DIN}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \left(V_{\text{N}} +  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d} \bar{I}}{\text{d} t} \right)\\
% % \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:sdin3}
%  s(\text{DIN}) = \frac{\text{d}\text{DIN}}{\text{d}t} = \frac{F_{\text{DON}-\text{DIN}} - \text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \left(V_{\text{N}} +  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}} \frac{\text{d} \bar{I}}{\text{d} t} \right)}{ 1+\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}}}
% \end{equation}

The final terms required in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin3} are the changes in $\bar{I}$, $L_{\text{D}}$ and $T$ over time, i.e., $\text{d}\,\bar{I} / \text{d}\,t$, $\text{d}\,L_{\text{D}} / \text{d}\,t$
and $\text{d}\,T / \text{d}\,t$.
When the irradiance and temperature are supplied externally, as typically the case in realistic coupled physical-biological models, it is not possible to obtain their temporal derivatives analytically.  Hence they are numerically approximated as the discrete backward difference between their current ($t=i$) and previous ($t=i-1$) values, divided by the integration time step, i.e., $\text{d}\, E / \text{d}\, t \approx (E_{i} - E_{i-1}) / \Delta t$ for $E=\{\bar{I},\ L_{\text{D}},\ T\}$ (see also Section~\ref{S:DescT1}).

As a technical remark regarding the FABM implementation of the model: Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin3} requires a combination of terms which are calculated by separate abiotic and phytoplankton modules in K21.  Therefore, in order to avoid a circular-dependency error in the current implementation, an intermediate module collects the necessary terms from the two modules, and sets the right-hand sides for DIN at once.

\subsection{Test setups and model operation}\label{S:DescSetup}
    %\subsubsection{0D setup (T1-T3)}
    For all tests, the model is operated in a spatially homogeneous 1-box setup, using the 0D driver of FABM \citep{Bruggeman2014}. With this 0D setup, numerical solutions are obtained using a 4\textsuperscript{th} order Runge-Kutta method with a time step of 60 seconds. Model forcing applied in our 0D setup varies among different tests, as explained below.

    \subsubsection{T1}\label{S:DescT1}
    This test is designed to assess the effect of inaccuracies incurred by the numerical approximation of the time-derivatives of external forcing variables.  We consider two cases with regard to irradiance: For PAR:N the time-derivative is approximated numerically and for PAR:A it is obtained analytically.  In both cases, irradiance ($\bar{I}$) is provided as a sinusoidal function of day of year ($t$) to represent a seasonal cycle representative of a high latitude environment in the northern hemisphere:
    \begin{flalign}\label{eq.I}
    \bar{I}(t) &= \bar{I}_{\min} + (\bar{I}_{\max}-\bar{I}_{\min}) 0.5 \left[ 1 + \sin \left[ 2 \pi t' \right]  \right], \qquad t' = \frac{t}{365} - 0.25
    \end{flalign}
    where $\bar{I}_{\min}= 1.6\, \mathrm{mol\,m^{-2}d^{-1}}$  and $\bar{I}_{\max} = \mathrm{110 \, mol\, m^{-2} d^{-1}}$ define the minimum and maximum values throughout the year and $t'$ represents the relative day of the year delayed by a quarter cycle to obtain the peak value at the middle of the year (see Fig.~\ref{f.T1light} for the behavior of the function with these parameters).  As simplifications for this test, we assume that temperature, T, is fixed at 10$\degree$C, fractional day length, $L_D$, is unity, and we ignore light attenuation.
    \begin{subequations}
      \begin{description}
      \item [PAR:N] in the first case, the time-derivative of $\bar{I}$ is calculated numerically as a finite-difference approximation:
        \begin{equation}\label{eq.dIdtn}
          \frac{\text{d}\,\bar{I}}{\text{d}\,t} \approx \frac{\bar{I}_{i} - \bar{I}_{i-1}}{\Delta t}
        \end{equation}
        where $i$ is the time-step index and $\Delta t$ the time step of the numerical integration.
      \item [PAR:A] in the second case, the temporal derivative of short wave radiation is calculated  analytically:
        \begin{equation}\label{eq.dIdt}
          \frac{\text{d}\,\bar{I}}{\text{d}\,t} = (\bar{I}_{\max}-\bar{I}_{\min}) \frac{\pi}{365} \cos \left[ 2 \pi t' \right]
        \end{equation}
      \end{description}
    \end{subequations}
    The temporal derivatives found by the numerical and analytical approaches are almost identical (Fig.~\ref{f.T1light}).

    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{T2 -- T3}

    For these tests, we apply the numerical and analytical time-derivatives for $\bar{I}$ (Eqs.~\ref{eq.dIdtn} and~\ref{eq.dIdt}) and also for variable day length, $L_{\text{D}}$, and temperature, T\@. $L_{\text{D}}$, as described by \citet{Forsythe2003}, is used to calculate the instantaneous irradiance, based on the irradiance function for T1 (as in the original model by \citet{Pahlowetal13}, and as was implemented in K21).  The seasonal variability in T is represented using a sinusoidal function similar to Eq.~\ref{eq.I}, but $T_{\min}$ and $T_{\max}$ set to 2 and 20$\degree$C, respectively.

    For T3, we simulated 10 phytoplankton groups with the IA and DA variants and compared their predictions. Phytoplankton groups were assumed to represent different size classes spread across 0.2--100 \unit{{\mu}m} equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) range, uniformly spaced on logarithmic scale. As in \citet{Smith2016}, we assumed that $Q_0$, $\hat{V}_0$ and $\hat{A}_0$ vary according to allometric relationships  (Table~\ref{T.pars}). Scalings of $Q_0$ and $\hat{V}_0$ are based on a combination of cell-specific scalings of subsistence quotas \citep[][`marine species']{Edwards2012}, maximum uptake rates \citep{Maranon2013}, and cell-specific C content \citep[][`protist plankton excluding diatoms']{Menden2000}. Scaling of $\hat{A}_0$ is based on heuristics, as explained in \citet{Smith2014a}. A detailed discussion of the allometric scaling of parameters can be found in \citet{Smith2016}.

    \markus{I have recently analysed compilations of N subsistence quotas from the literature (though not including \citet{Edwards2012}) and found that many of those were not really subsistence quotas.  When I exclude those not being subsistence quotas and whose ESD > 100\unit{{\mu}m}, there is no size dependence.}

% RESULTS
\section{Results}

\subsection{Accuracy of numerical approximation of temporal derivative of light (T1)}
The model is conservative with respect to C and mostly also N (Fig.~\ref{f.T1res}).  For PAR:N, total N slightly (about 0.02 \unit{mmolN\ m^{-3}}) increases at the very beginning of the simulation, which is caused by the unknown previous value of $\bar{I}$ during the first day of the simulation (as required by the numerical approximation of $\text{d}\,\bar{I}/\text{d}\,t$), which is set to the current value ($\bar{I}_{0} = \bar{I}_{1} \Rightarrow \text{d}\,\bar{I}/\text{d}\,t = 0$), causing therefore a difference between the total N as simulated by the analytical approach (PAR:A). However, after this initial jump, this new baseline is preserved until the end of the simulation. \markus{This is not shown in Fig.~\ref{f.T1res}: the blue curve starts out almost the same as the yellow curve and loses some N until the end of the simulation.  Maybe you confused this with Fig.~\ref{f.T2res}, top-right panel?}

\subsection{Testing the IA approach in a more realistic setup, in comparison to the fully explicit DA approach (T2)}

For this test, seasonal variations in $T$ and $L_{\text{D}}$ are considered as well (Fig.~\ref{f.T2env}).  Note that variations in $L_{\text{D}}$ also affect the seasonal cycles of $\bar{I}$ and $\text{d}\bar{I}/\text{d}t$.

%\subsection{Comparison of IA approach to the fully explicit DA approach (T2b)}

The IA and the fully explicit DA variants produce almost identical results (Figs.~\ref{f.T2res}--\ref{f.T2resbox}). This similarity is expected and in agreement with \citet{Ward2017}. On a closer look, some differences can be detected, such as a slightly higher $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ at the peak of the spring bloom and slightly higher $\text{Det}_{\text{N}}$ after the spring bloom simulated by the DA variant.  The differences are due to the re-allocation of part of the fluxes into and out of $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ to DIN fluxes in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin3}.  They remain relatively small because (1) the time scale of the optimal regulation of N uptake in the DA variant is short relative to those of phytoplankton growth and the DIN-changes in our simulations, and (2) the strong interaction between phytoplankton and DIN leads to a negative feed-back between the deviations between the IA and DA variants and the extra DIN fluxes caused by variations in $Q$ in the IA variant.

\subsection{T3: Comparing DA and IA variants in simulating in simulating multiple PFT's}\label{s.resT3}

Fig.~\ref{f.T3res} shows results of a numerical experiment with 10 phytoplankton size classes for our IA and DA variants. C biomass of phytoplankton by the two variants is near-identical. In this experiment annual average concentrations decrease with cell size, and the larger classes exhibit stronger seasonal relative variations. Under different environmental conditions, with respect to, e.g., the initial nutrient concentrations, and temporal stability, different outcomes can emerge \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Taherzadeh2017}, but such an exploration is outside of the scope of the current study.

As expected, the first type reaches higher C-biomass during the spring bloom, whereas the second type maintains higher concentrations during summer, under low nutrient concentrations. The predictions by the two variants are almost identical.

As a technical note regarding the technical implementation, using the \verb|phy_Cbased.F90| and \verb|abio_Cbased.F90| modules, the number of phytoplankton types can be changed without needing to change and recompile the code, by adjusting the configuration file (see the \verb|fabm.yaml| examples in the \verb|testcases| folder that were employed to produce the results presented in this study), which is a feature of the modularity of FABM\@.

% DISCUSSION
\section{Discussion}

In this study, we present FABM-NflexPD 2.0, a FABM implementation of the FlexPFT model introduced by \citet{Smith2016} with a few minor corrections (see the notes at the end of Appendix~\ref{S:Sol}). The precursor version of the model, FABM-NflexPD 1.0 \citep{Kerimoglu2021}, resolves only the N cycle, and the C-cycle is not closed. The version 2.0 described here can resolve both N- and C-cycles in a 0D setup, owing to an additional flux term to maintain the mass balance of N (Sections~\ref{S:DescFlux} and Appendix~\ref{S:Sol}).

\subsection{Re-establishing the Mass Balance}

Two variants of the model are elaborated here. The `Dynamic Acclimation' (DA) variant is fully explicit in its treatment of the C and N content of phytoplankton and is based on the model by \citet{Pahlowetal13}. The `Instantaneous Acclimation' (IA) variant aims to track the phytoplankton dynamics with a single state variable, based on a balanced growth approximation \citep{Burmaster1979}, that is, assuming that cells reach the equilibrium state instantaneously.

\markus{Owing to the lack of a state variable $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:dic} --~\eqref{eq:sDetN} do not preserve mass (total N) because they ignore the contribution of the rate of change of $Q$ to the rate of change of $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$.  It is impossible to maintain mass balance mechanistically without adding a state variable $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$.  We can re-establish mass balance for N, however, by assigning the missing N flux to the DIN compartment in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin3}.  While this may be a rather arbitrary measure for achieving N mass balance and also violates the assumptions behind the model by assigning part of $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ to DIN, the resulting differences compared to explicitly resolving $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ are relatively small \citep{Ward2017}.}

Through detailed tests, we show that C is fully conserved, whereas N is conserved to a very large degree (error: $<0.0001\%$ for all tests we conducted). We also show that the predictions of the IA and DA variants are mostly indistinguishable. Finally, with an example where we simulate 10 phytoplankton size classes with our two model variants, we demonstrate that the model is well aligned with the modular coupling philosophy of FABM \citep{Bruggeman2014}.

As explained in Section~\ref{S:DescFlux}, reducing the errors in mass balance for N requires explicitly calculating the changes in N quota in time, i.e., $\textrm{d}Q/\textrm{d}t$, which in turn requires calculation of individual components of this change driven by different environmental factors, namely, DIN, $\bar{I}$, T and $\textrm{L}_{\textrm{D}}$.  Under the idealized setup considered for T2, changes occurring in DIN is clearly the dominant source of variation in Q.  However, contributions by other factors are non-negligible (Fig.~\ref{f.T2dQdt}). In other setups, the relative importance of various environmental factors may be different. Relevance of these secondary factors to the elemental stoichiometry of phytoplankton is an often neglected aspect. We expect our mathematically explicit treatment of this issue to inspire and contribute to future endeavors to establish an analytical framework for investigating the mechanistic underpinnings of plankton physiology.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency and Application Potential}
Our results demonstrate that a state variable that tracks the elemental content of plankton can be effectively removed, without leading to major issues in mass balance, in a 0D setup. In comparison to a fully explicit dynamic variant, removing a state variable does not seem to result in clear advantages in computational efficiency, at least not for simulating a low number of phytoplankton groups.  However, when simulating 50 groups, IA is $\approx 10.2 \%$ faster (i.e., real time: 458 s instead of 510 s; see also Fig.~\ref{f.speed}). For simulations with a small number of groups, any potential reduction in computational costs owing to one less state variable in the IA variant is presumably compensated by the additional logic and calculations required (see Appendix-\ref{S:Sol}). However, for a larger number of groups, requirements for allocating memory to trace a greater number of state variables is probably outweighing the additional costs associated with the flux calculations \onur{these were some quick thoughts, if anyone knows something more about this, or a reference, please let me know}.

\caption{Simulation times for different numbers of phytoplankton groups.\label{f.speed}}
\end{figure}

The modelling framework FABM, in which the model is implemented, allows seamless coupling of models with various hydrodynamical hosts \citep{Bruggeman2014}. We have also attempted an application in a 1D setup using GOTM \citep{Burchard2006} as the hydrodynamical host, and found out that N is not conserved. This is to be expected, because the spatial transport calculations are not aware of spatial gradients in $Q$, which leads to the omission of part of the N fluxes, analogously to the difference between Eqs.~\eqref{eq:phyn_def} and~\eqref{eq:phyn}. Modified spatial flux terms may have to be introduced into the hydrodynamical host (which is the case with FABM).  It is not clear whether the resulting model would be faster than the fully explicit variant: On one hand, the reduced number of state variables in a spatially explicit setup means smaller transport matrices \onur{ANY REFs?}.  On the other hand, calculation of fluxes associated with changes in $Q$ requires additional logic and calculations. As mentioned above, performance advantages of the instantaneous acclimation approach emerged only for a large number of phytoplankton groups in our 0D setup.  However, in a spatially explicit setups, transport calculations can easily become computationally more demanding than calculating the right-hand sides of a biogeochemical model.  Therefore, a reduction of a state variable might offer computational advantages already for simulating a smaller number of phytoplankton groups.

%\section{Conclusions}


\codeavailability{For running the model and reproducing the results presented in this study, FABM and GOTM need to be installed. See \url{https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/wiki/GOTM} for the instructions. The version of the FABM-NflexPD used in this manuscript has been stored in a Zenodo repository \onur{todo}. Instructions for compiling FABM-NflexPD for GOTM-FABM and our 0D setup are provided in README.md. The \texttt{src} folder contains the Fortran code. The model was implemented as two separate modules: the \texttt{phy.F90} module that describes phytoplankton growth and the \texttt{abio.F90} module that describes everything other than phytoplankton (See Fig.~1 in \citet{Kerimoglu2021}). The phytoplankton module can reproduce the behavior of both the IA and DA variants considered in the manuscript by setting model parameters. The \texttt{testcases} folder contains the configuration (yaml) file that was used to produce the results for T1 -- T2 in this manuscript, and with two phytoplankton groups.}

\section{Analytical Solutions}\label{S:Sol}
To facilitate the solutions of the $\partial Q/\partial E$ ($E=\{\mathrm{DIN},\bar{I},\mathrm{T},\mathrm{L}_\mathrm{D}\}$) in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin3}, we introduce a new variable $Z$ and re-write Eq.~\eqref{eq:Qopt} in terms of $Z$ \citep[S16 in the following]{Smith2016}:
\begin{flalign}
  \label{eq.Z}
  Q &= \frac{Q_{0}}{2} \left( 1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{Z}}  \right), \qquad Z = \frac{Q_{0}}{2}\left( \frac{\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\hat{V}_{\text{N}}} + \zeta_{\text{N}} \right) \\
  \label{eq.delQdelN}
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \text{DIN}} &= \frac{\partial Q}{\partial Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \text{DIN}}, \qquad
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \bar{I}}  = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \bar{I}}, \qquad
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial L_{\text{D}}}, \qquad
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial T} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial T}
\end{flalign}
In Eqs.~\eqref{eq.delQdelN}, the common term $\partial Q / \partial Z$, as in S16, is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:delQdelZ}
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial Z} = \frac{-Q_{0}}{4 \cdot Z \cdot \sqrt{Z\cdot(1+Z)}}
\end{equation}
Recalling $\hat{V}_{\text{N}}$ from K21, Eq.~(17):
\begin{flalign}
  \hat{V}_{\text{N}} &= \frac{(1-f_{\text{A}})\hat{V}_{0} f_{\text{A}} \hat{A}_{0} \text{DIN}}{(1-f_{\text{A}})\hat{V}_{0} + f_{\text{A}} \hat{A}_{0} \text{DIN}}
  = \frac{\hat{V}_{0}\cdot \hat{A}_{0}\cdot\text{DIN}}{{(\sqrt{\hat{V}_{0}} + \sqrt{\hat{A}_{0}\cdot \text{DIN}})}^{2}}, \qquad
  f_{\text{A}} = \frac{1}{\displaystyle 1 + \sqrt{\frac{\hat{A}_{0}\cdot\text{DIN}}{\hat{V}_{0}}}} \\
  \intertext{We set the potential maximum rates of N and C acquisition numerically equal to the maximum-rate parameter $\mu_{0}$ \citep{Pahlowetal13}:}
  \label{eq:v0mu0}
  \hat{V}_{0} &= \hat{\mu}_{0} = \mu_{0} \cdot f(T) \qquad f(T) = \exp\left[ -\frac{E_{\text{a}}}{R}\left( \frac{1}{T / \text{K}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{ref}} / \text{K}} \right) \right]
\end{flalign}
the partial derivative of $Z$ with respect to DIN is:
\begin{flalign}
  \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \text{DIN}} = \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{V}_{\text{N}}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \hat{V}_{\text{N}}}{\mathrm{d}\, \text{DIN}}
  = -\frac{\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}} \cdot Q_{0}}{2 \cdot\hat{A}_{0}\cdot \text{DIN}^{2}} \left( 1 + \sqrt{\frac{\hat{A}_{0}\cdot \text{DIN}}{\hat{V}_{0}}} \right)
\end{flalign}

For calculating the partial derivative of $Z$ with respect to $\bar{I}$, ${\partial Z}/{\partial \bar{I}}$, we recall $\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}$, $L_{\text{I}}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ from K21, Eqs.~(20)--(23) \& (26):
\begin{flalign}
  \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}} &= L_{\text{D}}\hat{\mu}_{0} L_{\text{I}} (1-\zeta_{\text{Chl}}\hat{\theta})- R^{\text{Chl}}, \qquad
    R^{\text{Chl}} = f(T) \cdot R_{\text{M}}^{\text{Chl}} \zeta_{\text{Chl}}\hat{\theta} \\
  L_{\text{I}} &= 1 - \exp \left( \frac{-\alpha \hat{\theta} \bar{I}}{\hat{\mu}_{0}} \right), \qquad
  \hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{\zeta_{\text{Chl}}} + \frac{\hat{\mu}_{0}}{\alpha\cdot \bar{I}} \cdot (1 - W), \qquad
  W = \mathrm{W}_{0} \left[ \left( 1 + \frac{f(T) \cdot R_{\text{M}}^{{\text{Chl}}}}{L_{\text{D}} \cdot \hat{\mu}_{0}} \right)
   \cdot \exp \left( 1 + \frac{\alpha \cdot \bar{I}}{\hat{\mu}_{0} \cdot \zeta_{\text{Chl}}} \right) \right]
\end{flalign}
where $\mathrm{W}_{0}$ is the 0-branch of Lambert's W-function, and $\alpha$ and $\zeta_{\text{Chl}}$ are model parameters (initial Chl-specific slope of P-I curve and cost of Chl synthesis, respectively, Table~3 in K21). %  $\hat{\theta}$ is the optimal Chl density in the chloroplast.\\
$\partial Z/ \partial \bar{I}$ can then be derived by canonical application of the chain rule:
\begin{flalign}
 \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \bar{I}} &=
 \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}} \left( \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial\bar{I}}
   + \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial\hat{\theta}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \hat{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}\,\bar{I}} \right)
 = \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}} \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial\bar{I}}
 \qquad  (\text{because}~ \frac{\partial{\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}}{\partial \hat{\theta}} = 0 ~ \text{by definition}) \\
 \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}} &= \frac{Q_{0}}{2 \cdot \hat{V}_{\text{N}}} \\
 \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial\bar{I}} &= L_{\text{D}} \cdot (1-\hat{\theta} \cdot \zeta_{\text{Chl}})  \cdot \alpha \cdot \hat{\theta} \cdot (1-L_{\text{I}}) \\
% \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial\hat{\theta}} &= L_{\text{D}} \cdot [ \alpha \cdot \bar{I} \cdot ( 1 - L_{\text{I}} ) \cdot (1 - \zeta_{\text{Chl}} \cdot \hat{\theta}) - L_{\text{I}} \cdot \zeta_{\text{Chl}} \cdot \hat{\mu}_{0} ] - R_{\text{M}}^{\text{Chl}} \cdot \zeta_{\text{Chl}} \\
% \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \hat{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}\, \bar{I}} &= -\frac{\hat{\mu}_{0}}{\alpha\cdot \bar{I}^{2}} (1 - W) - \frac{W}{1 + W} \frac{1}{\bar{I}\cdot \zeta_{\text{Chl}}}
 \intertext{The day-length derivatives are}
 \frac{\partial Z}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} &= \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}} \left( \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial L_{\text{D}}}
   + \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial\hat{\theta}} \frac{\mathrm{d}\, \hat{\theta}}{\mathrm{d}\,\bar{I}} \right)
 = \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}} \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} \\
 \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial L_{\text{D}}} &= \hat{\mu}_{0} \cdot L_{\text{I}} \cdot (1 - \zeta_{\text{Chl}} \hat{\theta})
\end{flalign}
%The partial derivatives of $T$ Eq.~\eqref{eq:sdin3} are approximated numerically, as the analytical solution of $\partial Q/\partial T$ is unwieldy, given the temperature dependence of $\hat{\mu}_0$,  $\hat{V}_0$ and $R_{\text{M}}^{\text{Chl}}$, and numerous occurrence of these terms in intermediate quantities $\hat{\theta}$ and $L_{\text{I}}$ when $Q$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:Qopt}) is fully expanded. The numerical difference approximation is achieved by storing the value of $T$ in the previous integration step ($t=i-1$), calculating $Q$ based on this previous value of $T$ (but the values of DIN, $\bar{I}$ and $L_{\text{D}}$ in the current time step ($t=i$)), and subtracting this from the current value of $Q$, i.e.,
%\begin{align}
% \frac{\partial Q}{\partial T} & \approx
% \frac{Q(\text{DIN}_{i},\ \bar{I}_{i},\ L_{\text{D}_i},\ T_{i}) - Q(\text{DIN}_{i},\ \bar{I}_{i},\ L_{\text{D}_i},T_{i-1})} {T_{i} - T_{i-1}}
%\end{align}
The temperature-derivative of $Z$ is obtained via the derivatives with respect to $\hat{\mu}_{0}$, $\hat{V}_{0}$ and $R^{\text{Chl}}$:
\begin{flalign}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial Z}{\partial T}
    &=   \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}
      \left( \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{0}} \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{0}}{\partial T}
        + \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial R^{\text{Chl}}} \frac{\partial R^{\text{Chl}}}{\partial T} \right)
      + \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{V}_{\text{N}}} \frac{\partial \hat{V}_{\text{N}}}{\partial \hat{V}_{0}} \frac{\partial \hat{V}_{0}}{\partial T} \\ &
    = \left[ \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}
      \left( \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{0}} \cdot \hat{\mu}_{0} - R^{\text{Chl}} \right)
      + \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{V}_{0}} \cdot \hat{V}_{0}
    \right] \frac{1}{f(T)} \frac{\text{d}\,f(T)}{\text{d}\,T}
  \end{split}
  \\
  \frac{\partial \hat{\mu}_{net}}{\partial \hat{\mu}_{0}} &= L_{\text{D}} \cdot (1 - \zeta_{\text{Chl}} \hat{\theta})
  \left[ L_{\text{I}} - (1 - L_{\text{I}}) \frac{\alpha \cdot \bar{I}}{\hat{\mu}_{0}} \hat{\theta} \right] \qquad
  \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \hat{V}_{0}} = -\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}} \frac{Q_{0}}{2 \hat{\mu}_{0} \sqrt{\hat{\mu}_{0} \cdot \hat{V}_{\text{N}}}} \\
  \frac{1}{f(T)} \frac{\text{d}\,f(T)}{\text{d}\,T} &= \frac{E_{\text{a}}}{R\cdot {(T / \text{K})}^{2}}
\end{flalign}

We would like to clarify that
%(1) the DIN in the denominator in the solution provided by S16 (their Eq.~A-5) was a typo;
(1) replacement of $\hat{\mu}_g$ (in S16, $\hat{\mu}^I$) with $\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}}$ in our model (see K21) results in the appearance of $(1-\hat{\theta} \cdot \zeta_{\text{Chl}})$ when computing $\partial \hat{\mu}_{\text{net}} / \partial \bar{I}$;
(2) $L_{\text{D}}$ used to be implicit in S16, now it's explicit (K21 Eq.~21) therefore it appears for $\partial\hat{\mu}_{\text{net}} / \partial \bar{I}$ unlike in S16; (3) Changes in $Q$ due to T were not accounted for by \citet{Smith2016}.

% \section{Relevance of changes in quota for the loss processes}\label{S:appQ4loss}  %% Appendix-A
% \onur{Not sure whether we want to keep this}
% %In our model, we considered a single loss process for phytoplankton.
% %Recalling from K21 (Table 1) that the associated N flux term was expressed as
% %\begin{flalign}
% % F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}-\text{Det}_{\text{N}}} &= m \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{N}}^2 &&
% %\end{flalign}
% %and considering that $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}=\text{Phy}_{\text{C}} \cdot Q$, it can be thought that the changes in $Q$ needs to be taken into account for calculating the flux between phytoplankton and detrital N due to mortality.
% Potential links between cellular quotas and loss processes can be assessed by analyzing the components of the changes in $\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}$ occurring due to loss terms, as was previously done for the case of growth (Eq.~\eqref{eq:dphyNdt}). Observing that the only loss process we considered here is mortality:
% \begin{flalign}
%   \frac{\text{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}}{\text{d}\,t} \bigg\rvert_L
%   &=\frac{\text{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{C}} Q}{\text{d}\,t} \bigg\rvert_M
%   = Q \frac{\text{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\text{d}\,t} \bigg\rvert_M + \text{Phy}_{\text{N}}\frac{\text{d}\,\text{Q}_{\text{N}}}{\text{d}\,t} \bigg\rvert_M
% \end{flalign}
% Here, in the first term, $\frac{\text{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\text{d}\,t} \rvert_M$ represents the C-based mortality rate ($=m \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}^2$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:mortC}). In the second term, $\frac{\text{d}\,\text{Q}_{\text{N}}}{\text{d}\,t} \rvert_M$ represents the changes occurring in $Q$, however, due to mortality only. As in our model, we did not consider any effect of mortality on quota (assuming that when a cell dies, it dies altogether and all of its contents become detritus), this term collapses to 0, therefore reducing the associated flux term to:
% \begin{flalign}
% F_{\text{Phy}_{\text{N}}-\text{Det}_{\text{N}}} &=
% Q \frac{\text{d}\,\text{Phy}_{\text{C}}}{\text{d}\,t} \bigg\rvert_M = Q \cdot m \cdot \text{Phy}_{\text{C}}^2
% \end{flalign}
% However, in any other model that may consider processes that may affect the cellular quotas, such as excretion of C-rich, N-poor substances, associated consequences on various elemental fluxes can be taken into account following this framework.
