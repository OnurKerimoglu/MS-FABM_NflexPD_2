abstract = {Abstract Planktonic ecosystems are usually modeled in terms of autotrophic and heterotrophic compartments. However, the trophic strategy of unicellular organisms can take a range of mixotrophic strategies with both autotrophic and heterotrophic contributions. The dominant emerging strategy found in nature depends on the environment (both biotic and abiotic aspects) and the cell size and influences key ecosystem functions like trophic transfer and carbon export. Ecosystem models that faithfully represent this diversity of trophic strategies are lacking. Here we develop a trait-based model of unicellular plankton with cell size as the master trait and three other traits that determine trophic strategies: investments in photosynthesis, nutrient uptake, and phagotrophy. This unicellular model spans the entire auto- mixo- hererotrophic strategy continuum and the entire size range of unicellular organisms. The model reproduces observed latitudinal patterns in biomass, primary productivity, vertical carbon export, and energy transfer efficiency; all increase with increasing latitude. The size range of mixotrophic cells is independent of the season at low latitudes. At high latitudes, the dominance of pure phototrophs during early spring restricts mixotrophic behavior to a narrower range of cell sizes and with the occurrence of relatively smaller mixotrophs during summer. The model's ability to adapt to different environmental conditions, combined with its simple conceptual structure and low number of parameters and state variables (10), makes it ideally suited for global simulation studies under changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Some formulations relating nutrient concentration to nutrient transport and to nutrient-limited growth rate are derived. Experimental examples are given in which transport restricts maximal growth rate in some cases and does not affect it in others. It is demonstrated that normal variations in cell yield from substrate consumed at various growth rates can generate curvature in growth kinetic curves unrelated to saturation phenomena. Nutrient uptake and growth rate versus concentration curves are diagrammed for a range of situations, and the kinetic constants for these curves are discussed. The definition of a previously introduced term, the affinity, is sharpened and literature values compiled. It is suggested that this is one of the more useful kinetic constants for describing the kinetics of aquatic microbial processes. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {A modelling system for coupled physicalbiogeochemical simulations in the water column is presented here. The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple NPZ to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},

abstract = {A global three{\~{}}dimensional marine ecosystem model with several key phytoplankton functional groups, multiple limiting nutrients, explicit iron cycling, and a mineral ballast/organic matter parameterization is run within a global ocean circulation model. The coupled biogeochemistry/ecosystem/circulation (BEC) model reproduces known basin{\~{}}scale patterns of primary and export production, biogenic silica production, calcification, chlorophyll, macronutrient and dissolved iron concentrations. The model captures observed high nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions in the Southern Ocean, subarctic and equatorial Pacific. Spatial distributions of nitrogen fixation are in general agreement with field data, with total N{\~{}}fixation of 55 Tg N. Diazotrophs directly account for a small fraction of primary production (0.5$\backslash${\%}) but indirectly support 10$\backslash${\%} of primary production and 8$\backslash${\%} of sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) export. Diatoms disproportionately contribute to export of POC out of surface waters, but CaCO3 from the coccolithophores is the key driver of POC flux to the deep ocean in the model. An iron source from shallow ocean sediments is found critical in preventing iron limitation in shelf regions, most notably in the Arctic Ocean, but has a relatively localized impact. In contrast, global-scale primary production, export production, and nitrogen fixation are all sensitive to variations in atmospheric mineral dust inputs. The residence time for dissolved iron in the upper ocean is estimated to be a few years to a decade. Most of the iron utilized by phytoplankton is from subsurface sources supplied by mixing, entrainment, and ocean circulation. However, owing to the short residence time of iron in the upper ocean, this subsurface iron pool is critically dependent on continual replenishment from atmospheric dust deposition and, to a lesser extent, lateral transport from shelf regions.},

abstract = {Within models, zooplankton grazing is typically defined as being dependent on total prey concentration, with feeding selectivity expressed only as a function of prey size. This behavior ignores taxonomic preferences shown by the predators and the capacity of some zooplankton to actively select or reject individual prey items from mixtures. We carried out two model experiments comparing impacts of zooplankton displaying passive and active selection, which resulted in contrasting dynamics for the pelagic system. Passive selection by the grazer resulted in a top down control on the prey with a fast turn-over of nutrients. Active selection, on the other hand led to a bottom-up control, with slower nutrient turnover constraining primary production by changing the system toward export of particulate matter. Our results suggest that selective feeding behavior is an important trait, and should be considered alongside size and taxonomy when studying the role of zooplankton impact in the ecosystem.},

abstract = {A simulation model of vertically migrating phytoplankton is presented, using a Lagrangian, individual-based computational approach. Algal cells acquire and store nutrient at the bottom of the habitat, using stored nutrient to grow while in shallower waters. Stored nutrient also governs movement: cells sink when their nutrient quota falls below a threshold; otherwise they rise (or at least sink more slowly). Although the bottom of the habitat provides the growth-limiting nutrient, it also entails a risk of mortality. For a parameter set representing phosphorus-limited algae with a fixed nutrient storage capacity, neither continual sinking nor continual rising are optimal strategies. Instead, an adaptive dynamics approach suggests there is an optimal movement strategy in which cells rise when their storage capacity is partially filled, and otherwise sink. When the movement strategy is fixed in such a way and storage capacity is free to evolve, storage capacity approaches an optimal value several times higher than the minimal quota permitting population growth. Vertical movement and nutrient storage affect the vertical distribution of total nutrient. When cells always sink, total nutrient declines exponentially from the nutrient source at the bottom to a surface minimum. When cells always rise, there is a peak of total nutrient at the bottom, and another at the surface, with a minimum between. When cells move optimally, the vertical distribution of total nutrient can be close to uniform, or have a peak at mid-depth.},

abstract = {Measures to reduce eutrophication have often led to a more effective decline of phosphorus (P) than nitro- gen (N) concentrations. The resultant changes in riverine nutrient loads can cause an increase in the N : P ratios of coastal waters. During four research cruises along a 450 km transect, we investigated how reductions in nutrient inputs during the past 25 yr have affected nutrient limitation patterns in the North Sea. This revealed a strong offshore gradient of dissolved inorganic N : P ratios in spring, from 375 : 1 nearshore toward 1 : 1 in the central North Sea. This gradient was reflected in high nearshore N : P and C : P ratios of particulate organic matter (mainly phytoplankton), indicative of severe P deficiency of coastal phytoplank- ton, which may negatively affect higher trophic levels in the food web. Nutrient enrichment bioassays per- formed on-board showed P and Si limitation of phytoplankton growth nearshore, co-limitation of N and P in a transitional region, and N limitation in the outer-shore waters, confirming the existence of an offshore gra- dient from P to N limitation. Different species were limited by different nutrients, indicating that further reductions of P loads without concomitant reductions of N loads will suppress colonial Phaeocystis blooms, but will be less effective in diminishing harmful algal blooms by dino- and nanoflagellates. Hence, our results provide evidence that de-eutrophication efforts in northwestern Europe have led to a large imbalance in the N : P stoichiometry of coastal waters of the North Sea, with major consequences for the growth, species com- position, and nutritional quality of marine phytoplankton communities.

The euphotic zone is divided into nutrient-limited and light-limited regions. For simplicity, the regeneration term is ignored, and a steady state is assumed. The uptake of major nutrients is assumed to follow the Michaelis-Menton expression, and some data indicate that the assumption is probably correct. Also assuming a dominant phytoplankton population, with characteristic Michaelis-Menton kinetic parameters, it is demonstrated that the size of the population, fractional growth rate, the rate of production, and the concentration of limiting nutrient are determined by the sum of the fractional loss rates for the phytoplankton. The role of micronutrient components of enzymes is developed theoretically using the effect of molybdenum on a nitrate-limited system as an example. For the sea, the significance of nutrient limitation theory is primarily in the study of phytoplankton competition and succession. Applications to lakes are discussed, and it appears that the effects of micronutrient deficiencies are more likely to be observed there than in the sea.},

abstract = {We re-examine what controls the deep ocean N:P ratio in the light of recent findings that the C:N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton varies with growth rate, nutrient and light limitation, species and phylum, and that N-2-fixation may be limited by Fe, temperature and/or light in large parts of the world ocean. In particular, we assess whether a systematic change in phytoplankton stoichiometry can alter the deep ocean N:P ratio. To do this we adapt recent models to include non-Redfieldian stoichiometry of phytoplankton and restriction of N-2-fixers to a fraction of the surface ocean. We show that a systematic change in phytoplankton C:N:P can alter the concentrations of NO3 and PO4 in the deep ocean but cannot greatly alter their ratio, unless it also alters the N: P threshold for N-2-fixation. This occurs if competitive dynamics set the N:P threshold for N-2-fixation, in which case it remains close to the N: P requirement of non-fixers (rather than that of N-2-fixers) and consequently so does the deep ocean N:P ratio. Then, even if N-2-fixers are restricted to a fraction of the surface ocean, they reach higher densities there, minimising variations in deep ocean N: P. Theoretical limits on the N:P requirements of phytoplankton suggest that whilst the deep ocean has been well oxygenated (i.e. since the Neoproterozoic, with the possible exception of Oceanic Anoxic Events), its N:P ratio is unlikely to have varied by more than a factor of two in either direction. Within these bounds, evolutionary changes in phytoplankton composition, and increased phosphorus weathering due to the biological colonisation of the land surface, are predicted to have driven long-term changes in ocean composition.},

abstract = {An ecosystem model embedded in a one-dimensional physical model is used to study the stoichiometry of carbon and nitrogen cycling at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series site. The model successfully provides a budget for the processes contributing to the drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that is observed in surface waters in the absence of detectable nitrate throughout much of the summer. The modeled drawdown is initially driven by export fueled by in situ N and accumulation of dissolved organic carbon, with continued DIC consumption after nutrient exhaustion resulting largely from nitrogen fixation and outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere. The modeled export flux of organic C at 300 m is dominated by particles (81{\%}), with a nevertheless significant fraction (19{\%}) due to dissolved organic matter. The predicted combined C/N of particulate and dissolved export increases from 10.8 at 70m to 14.3 at 300m, because of preferential remineralization of N. In theory, at least as a first approximation, the ratio of net consumption of DIC and nutrients in the euphotic zone is equivalent to this C/N of export. However, the C/N of consumption during DIC drawdown averaged 23.5 ({\textgreater}10.8), indicating that this assumption is not always valid and C/N ratios of nutrient consumption cannot reliably be used to estimate the export ratio, which is difficult to measure directly. The work highlights the complex interplay between the cycling of C and N the upper ocean and the resultant export flux. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The export of organic matter from the oceanic euphotic zone is a critical process in the global biogeochemical cycling of bioelements (C, N, P, Si). Much of this export occurs in the form of sinking particles, which rain down into the unlit waters of the deep sea. Classical models of oceanic production and export balance this gravitational loss of particulate bioelements with an upward flux of dissolved nutrients, and they describe reasonably well those areas of the ocean where deep winter mixing occurs. The surface waters of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), however, are strongly stratified and chronically nutrient-depleted, especially in summer. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that blooms of phytoplankton and subsequent pulses of particle export occur during the height of summer stratification in these waters, especially to the northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. These blooms impact regional bioelemental cycling and act as a food source to the deep-sea benthos. We review here numerous published observations of these events in the NPSG, and present new data collected at Station ALOHA (22.75°N, 158°W) during the first 176 cruises of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series program (1988-2005), along with results from transect cruises conducted in the region in 1996 and 2005. We suggest that the summer phytoplankton bloom can be considered a frequent, perhaps annual feature in the northeastern NPSG, and that its perceived stochastic nature is a manifestation of chronic undersampling in time and space. The bloom is typically dominated by only a few genera of large diatoms and the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium. It appears to be consistently supported by dinitrogen fixation, but the fate of the organic matter produced during the summer depends critically on the species composition of the responsible diazotrophs. We estimate that the summer bloom is responsible for up to 38{\%} of N2 fixation and up to 18{\%} of N-based new production annually at Station ALOHA. We hypothesize that the spatial distribution, timing and magnitude of the bloom may be determined largely by the physical and biological processes controlling new phosphorus delivery into the euphotic zone during the summer and the preceding winter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new marine ecosystem model designed for the global domain is presented, and model output is compared with field data from nine different locations. Field data were collected as part of the international Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program, and from historical time series stations. The field data include a wide variety of marine ecosystem types, including nitrogen- and iron-limited systems, and different physical environments from high latitudes to the mid-ocean gyres. Model output is generally in good agreement with field data from these diverse ecosystems. These results imply that the ecosystem model presented here can be reliably applied over the global domain. The model includes multiple potentially limiting nutrients that regulate phytoplankton growth rates. There are three phytoplankton classes, diatoms, diazotrophs, and a generic small phytoplankton class. Growth rates can be limited by available nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and/or light levels. The diatoms can also be limited by silicon. The diazotrophs are capable of nitrogen fixation of N2 gas and cannot be nitrogen-limited. Calcification by phytoplankton is parameterized as a variable fraction of primary production by the small phytoplankton group. There is one zooplankton class that grazes the three phytoplankton groups and a large detrital pool. The large detrital pool sinks out of the mixed layer, while a smaller detrital pool, representing dissolved organic matter and very small particulates, does not sink. Remineralization of the detrital pools is parameterized with a temperature-dependent function. We explicitly model the dissolved iron cycle in marine surface waters including inputs of iron from subsurface sources and from atmospheric dust deposition. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Phytoplankton acclimate to changing environmental conditions by a complex reallocation of carbon and energy through metabolic pathways to optimize growth. Considering the tremendous diversity of phytoplankton, it is not surprising that different phytoplankton taxa use different strategies to partition carbon and energy resources. It has therefore been satisfying to discover that general principles of energetic stoichiometry appear to govern these complex processes and can be broadly applied to interpret phytoplankton distributions, productivity, and food web dynamics. The expectation of future changes in aquatic environments brought on by climate change warrants gathering knowledge about underlying patterns of photosynthetic energy allocation and their impacts on community structure and ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {Current aquatic ecosystem models accommodate increasing amounts of physiological detail, but marginalize the role of biodiversity by aggregating multitudes of different species. We propose that at present, understanding of aquatic ecosystems is likely to benefit more from improved descriptions of biodiversity and succession than from incorporation of more realistic physiology. To illustrate how biodiversity can be accounted for, we define the system of infinite diversity (SID), which characterizes ecosystems in the spirit of complex adaptive systems theory as single units adapting to environmental pressure. The SID describes an ecosystem with one generic population model and continuity in species-characterizing parameters, and acquires rich dynamics by modeling succession as evolution of the parameter value distribution. This is illustrated by a four-parameter phytoplankton model that minimizes physiological detail, but includes a sophisticated representation of community diversity and interspecific differences. This model captures several well-known aquatic ecosystem features, including formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum and nutrient-driven seasonal succession. As such, it integrates theories on changes in species composition in both time and space. We argue that despite a lack of physiological detail, SIDs may ultimately prove a valuable tool for further qualitative and quantitative understanding of ecosystems.},

We find that interactions between environmental conditions and cellular growth are key to understanding stoichiometric regulation, but the growth rates of most marine plankton populations are poorly constrained. We propose that specific physiological mechanisms have a strong impact on plankton and community stoichiometry in nutrient-rich environments, whereas biogeochemical interactions are important for the stoichiometry of the oligotrophic gyres. Finally, we outline key areas with missing information that is needed to advance understanding of the present and future ecological stoichiometry of ocean plankton.},

Two main explanations have been proposed. The first attributes the N:P variability to changes in the community composition of well-adapted phytoplankton. The second proposes that variability arises from physiological acclimation involving intracellular adjustments of nutrient allocation under nutrient deficiency. Using a model of phytoplankton physiology, observational datasets, and a review of laboratory culture results, we assess the mechanistic basis of N:P variability. We find that the taxonomic composition of well-adapted phytoplankton best explains observed variations in POM N:P. Furthermore, we show that acclimation to nutrient deficiency may be safely neglected when considering the effects of ecology on POM N:P. These findings provide insight into the controls on global variability in POM composition and average phytoplankton physiological performance in the oceans.},

abstract = {We examined the factors that determine the citations of 153 mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling papers published from 1990 to 2002. Our analysis provides overwhelming evidence that ocean modeling is a dynamic area of the current modeling practice. Models developed to gain insight into the ocean carbon cycle/marine biogeochemistry are most highly cited, the produced knowledge is exported to other cognitive disciplines, and oceanic modelers are less reluctant to embrace technical advances (e.g., assimilation schemes) and more critically increase model complexity. Contrary to our predictions, model application for environmental management issues on a local scale seems to have languished; the pertinent papers comprise a smaller portion of the published modeling literature and receive lower citations. Given the critical planning information that these models aim to provide, we hypothesize that the latter finding probably stems from conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions, and an evident lack of haste from modelers to adopt new ideas in their repertoire when addressing environmental management issues. We also highlight the lack of significant association between citation frequency and model complexity, model performance, implementation of conventional methodological steps during model development (e.g., validation, sensitivity analysis), number of authors, and country of affiliation. While these results cast doubt on the rationale of the current modeling practice, the fact that the Fasham et al. (1990) paper has received over 400 citations probably dictates what should be done from the modeling community to meet the practical need for attractive and powerful modeling tools.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in projections of marine biogeochemistry from Earth system models (ESMs) are associated to a large degree with the imperfect representation of the marine plankton ecosystem, in particular the physiology of primary and secondary producers. Here, we describe the implementation of an optimality-based plankton-ecosystem model (OPEM) version 1.1 with variable carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus (C: N: P) stoichiometry in the University of Victoria ESM (UVic; Eby et al., 2009; Weaver et al., 2001) and the behaviour of two calibrated reference configurations, which differ in the assumed temperature dependence of diazotrophs. Predicted tracer distributions of oxygen and dissolved inorganic nutrients are similar to those of an earlier fixed-stoichiometry formulation in UVic (Nickelsen et al., 2015). Compared to the classic fixed-stoichiometry UVic model, OPEM is closer to recent satellite-based estimates of net community production (NCP), despite overestimating net primary production (NPP), can better reproduce deep-ocean gradients in the NO−3 : PO34− ratio and partially explains observed patterns of particulate C: N: P in the surface ocean. Allowing diazotrophs to grow (but not necessarily fix N2) at similar temperatures as other phytoplankton results in a better representation of surface Chl and NPP in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Deficiencies of our calibrated OPEM configurations may serve as a magnifying glass for shortcomings in global biogeochemical models and hence guide future model development. The overestimation of NPP at low latitudes indicates the need for improved representations of temperature effects on biotic processes, as well as phytoplankton community composition, which may be represented by locally varying parameters based on suitable trade-offs. The similarity in the overestimation of NPP and surface autotrophic particulate organic carbon (POC) could indicate deficiencies in the representation of top-down control or nutrient supply to the surface ocean. Discrepancies between observed and predicted vertical gradients in particulate C: N: P ratios suggest the need to include preferential P remineralisation, which could also benefit the representation of N2 fixation. While OPEM yields a much improved distribution of surface N* (NO−3 − 16 {\textperiodcentered} PO34− + 2.9 mmol m−3), it still fails to reproduce observed N* in the Arctic, possibly related to a misrepresentation of the phytoplankton community there and the lack of benthic denitrification in the model. Coexisting ordinary and diazotrophic phytoplankton can exert strong control on N* in our simulations, which questions the interpretation of N* as reflecting the balance of N2 fixation and denitrification.},

abstract = {We use a statistical emulator technique, the polynomial chaos expansion, to estimate time-dependent values for two parameters of a 3-dimensional biological ocean model. We obtain values for the phytoplankton carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and the zooplankton grazing rate by minimizing the misfit between simulated and satellite-based surface chlorophyll. The misfit is measured by a spatially averaged, time-dependent distance function. A cross-validation experiment demonstrates that the influence of outlying satellite data can be diminished by smoothing the distance function in time. The optimal values of the two parameters based on the smoothed distance function exhibit a strong time-dependence with distinct seasonal differences, without overfitting observations. Using these time-dependent parameters, we derive (hindcast) state estimates in two distinct ways: (1) by using the emulator-based interpolation and (2) by performing model runs with time-dependent parameters. Both approaches yield chlorophyll state estimates that agree better with the observations than model estimates with globally optimal, constant parameters. Moreover, the emulator approach provides us with estimates of parameter-induced model state uncertainty, which help determine at what time improvement in the model simulation is possible. The time-dependence of the analyzed parameters can be motivated biologically by naturally occurring seasonal changes in the composition of the plankton community. Our results suggest that the parameter values of typical biological ocean models should be treated as time-dependent and will result in a better representation of plankton dynamics in these models. We further demonstrate that emulator techniques are valuable tools for data assimilation and for analyzing and improving biological ocean models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Biodiversity of phytoplankton is important for ecosystem stability and marine biogeochemistry. However, the large-scale patterns of diversity are not well understood and are often poorly characterized in terms of statistical relationships with factors such as latitude, temperature and productivity. Here we use ecological theory and a global traitbased ecosystem model to provide mechanistic understanding of patterns of phytoplankton diversity. Our study suggests that phytoplankton diversity across three dimensions of trait space (size, biogeochemical function and thermal tolerance) is controlled by disparate combinations of drivers: the supply rate of the limiting resource, the imbalance in different resource supplies relative to competing phytoplankton demands, size-selective grazing and transport by the moving ocean. Using sensitivity studies we show that each dimension of diversity is controlled by different drivers. Models including only one (or two) of the trait dimensions will have different patterns of diversity than one which incorporates another trait dimension. We use the results of our model exploration to infer the controls on the diversity patterns derived from ﬁeld observations along meridional transects in the Atlantic and to explain why different taxa and size classes have differing patterns.},

abstract = {We propose definitions in terminology to enhance ongoing collaborations between biologists and modellers on plankton ecology. Organism "functional type" should refer to commonality in ecology not biogeochemistry; the latter is largely an emergent property of the former, while alignment with ecology is also consistent with usage in terrestrial science. Adaptation should be confined, as in genetics, to consideration of species inter-generational change; most so-called "adaptive" plankton models are thus acclimative, modifying vital rates in response to stimuli. Trait trade-off approaches should ideally only be considered for describing intra-generational interactions; in applications between generations, and certainly between unrelated species, such concepts should be avoided. We suggest that systems biology approaches, through to complex adaptive/acclimative systems modelling, with explicit modelling of feedback processes (which we suggest should define "mechanistic" models), would provide realistic and flexible bases upon which to develop descriptions of functional type models.},

Z. 49, 333–369] in which they showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme–substrate complex predicted by the Michaelis–Menten equation. Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information. Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten's data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather Vmax/Km, the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (kcat/Km × E0).},

abstract = {On the basis of the assumption that natural selection should tend to produce organisms optimally adapted to their environments, we consider optimality as a guiding concept for abstracting the behavior of aquatic micro-organisms (plankton) to develop models to study and predict the behavior of planktonic organisms and communities. This is closely related to trait-based ecology, which considers that traits and functionality can be understood as the result of the optimization inherent in natural selection, subject to constraints imposed by fundamental processes necessary for life. This approach is particularly well suited to plankton because of their long evolutionary history and the ease with which they can be manipulated in experiments. We review recent quantitative modeling studies of planktonic organisms that have been based on the assumption that adaptation of species and acclimation of organisms maximize growth rate. Compared with mechanistic models not formulated in terms of optimality, this approach has in some cases yielded simpler models, and in others models of greater generality. The evolutionary success of any given species must depend on its interactions with both the physical environment and other organisms, which depend on the evolving traits of all organisms concerned. The concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) can, at least in principle, constrain the choice of goal functions to be optimized in models. However, the major challenge remains of how to construct models at the level of organisms that can resolve short-term dynamics, e.g., of phytoplankton blooms, in a way consistent with ESS theory, which is formulated in terms of a steady state.},

abstract = {In this paper, we show that numerical solutions of the single-layer quasigeostrophic equation in a beta-plane basin approach the state predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics when the forcing and dissipation are (unrealistically) flow, consists of a quasi-steady uniform westward interior flow closed by inertial boundary layers. When wind stress and bottom drag are switched on, we find that the nonlinear terms in the quasigeostrophic equation still try to drive the flow toward Fofonoff flow, but their success at this depends strongly on the geometry of the wind stress. If the prescribed wind stress exerts a torque with the right sign to balance the bottom-drag torque around every closed streamline of the Fofonoff flow, then solutions to the wind-driven quasigeostrophic equation are energetic, Fofonoff-like, and nearly steady. If, on the other hand, the wind opposes Fofonoff flow, the wind-driven solutions are turbulent, with small mean flows, and much less energy. Our results suggest that integral conservation laws (on which the equilibrium statistical mechanics is solely based) largely define the role of the nonlinearities this viewpoint, we demonstrate in the quasigeostrophic equation. To support a resemblance between the solutions of the quasigeostrophic equation and the solutions of a stochastic model equation. The stochastic model equation, in which the advected vorticity is replaced by a random variable, has only gross conservation laws in common with the quasigeostrophic equation.},

abstract = {In a series of 188 experiments on the, light‐saturation curve for natural assemblages of phytoplankton at 3 stations in Nova Scotia coastal waters, it was found that both the initial slope ($\alpha$) of the curve and the assimilation number (PmB) varied about 5‐fold throughout the year. No differences could be detected between stations, but both $\alpha$ and PmB decreased with depth. The mean value of $\alpha$ for all the experiments was 0.21 mg C[mg Chl a]−1{\textperiodcentered} h−1{\textperiodcentered} W−1{\textperiodcentered} m2 with a range from 0.03 to 0.63. An explanation is offered for the nonconstancy of a in terms of the effect of cell‐size and shape on self‐shading. An estimate is made from first principles of the physiological maximum‐attainable value of $\alpha$. This estimate corresponds, within the limits of experimental error, to the highest values of $\alpha$ observed in the study. It is deduced that on the average the phytoplankton were photosynthesizing at only 44{\%} maximum capacity. The mean value of PmB for all experiments was 4.9 mg C[mg Chl a]−1{\textperiodcentered} h−1, with a range from 0.73 to 24.8. In the matrix of partial correlation coefficients, $\alpha$ and PmB were positively correlated with each other; $\alpha$ was correlated with mean solar radiation averaged over the 3 days prior to the experiment, but uncorrelated with temperature; PmB was correlated strongly with temperature but uncorrelated with recent solar radiation. The results show that PmB could be estimated from $\alpha$ and temperature using an empirical multiple regression equation, independent of depth. It is suggested that $\alpha$ and PmB are both correlated with some other factor not measured in the study, perhaps the mean cell‐size of the populations, or the nutrient status of the cells. The predictability of primary production is discussed in the light of this evidence. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1976, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Empirical algorithms allow the retrieval of chlorophyll a and non-living Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations. These data are used to constrain a coupled 3D physical-biogeochemical model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf. Two issues are investigated, depending on the variable used, to constrain the winter to spring phytoplankton production for the year 2001. First, SPM data is used as forcing data to correct the corresponding state variable of our model. This allows the realistic simulation of the light limited bloom at the end of February 2001, as observed with SeaWiFS chlorophyll a images and from the NUTRIGAS field cruise. Second, chlorophyll a data is used for parameter estimation of the biogeochemical model. The ability of assimilating these data is tested to improve the simulation of strong blooms observed in late May 2001 in the Loire and Gironde plumes. A global optimization method (Evolutive Strategies) is adapted to the complete 3-D coupled model, in order to find the best set of parameters. The hydrological conditions during the bloom can be validated with data from the PEL01 field cruise. After selection of the most sensitive parameters, the method is tested with twin experiments. Then, the use of real SeaWiFS data reduces the model/data misfit by a factor of two, improving the simulation of bloom intensities and extensions. The sets of parameters retrieved in each plume are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Selection will favor the evolution of traits that allow individuals to proactively compensate for such reduced fitness. Although several well-known processes can achieve this goal, they are still often neglected and often not clearly distinguished. To facilitate greater attention to the full range of processes by which individuals can increase their fitness, we present a classification scheme that integrates these: phenotypic change, selection of the environment, and adjustment of the environment. We outline how these individual-level processes relate to natural selection and population-level fitness. This framework may help to guide research (and teaching) about how individuals and populations may respond to environmental change.},

abstract = {We report the first application of a biogeochemical model in which the major elemental composition of the phytoplankton is flexible, and responds to changing light and nutrient conditions. The model includes two phytoplankton groups: diatoms and non-siliceous picoplankton. Both fix C in accordance with photosynthesis-irradiance relationships used in other models and take up NO 3- and NH4+ (and Si(OH)4 for diatoms) following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The model allows for light dependence of photosynthesis and NO3- uptake, and for the observed near-total light independence of NH4+ uptake and Si(OH)4 uptake. It tracks the resulting /N ratios of both phytoplankton groups and Si/N ratio of diatoms, and permits uptake of C, N and Si to proceed independently of one another when those ratios are close to those of nutrient-replete phytoplankton. When the C/N or Si/N ratio of either phytoplankton group indicates that its growth is limited by N, Si or light, uptake of non-limiting elements is controlled by the content of the limiting element in accordance with the cell-quota formulation of Droop (J. Mar. Biol. Ass. U.K 54 (1974) 825). We applied this model to the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site in the western Sargasso Sea. The model was tuned to produce vertical profiles and time courses of [NO3-], [NH4+] and [Si(OH)4] that are consistent with the data, by adjusting the kinetic parameters for N and Si uptake and the rate of nitrification. The model then reproduces the observed time courses of chlorophyll-a, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, biogenic silica, primary productivity, biogenic silica production and POC export with no further tuning. Simulated C/N and Si/N ratios of the phytoplankton indicate that N is the main growth-limiting nutrient throughout the thermally stratified period and that [Si(OH)4], although always limiting to the rate of Si uptake by diatoms, seldom limits their growth rate. The model requires significant nitrification in the upper 200 m to yield realistic time courses and vertical profiles of [NH4+] and [NO3-], suggesting that NO3- is not supplied to the upper water column entirely by physical processes. A nitrification- corrected f-ratio (fNC), calculated for the upper 200 m as: (NO 3- uptake - nitrification)/(NO3- uptake+ NH4+ uptake) has annual values ranging from only ∼0.05-0.09, implying that 90-95{\%} of the N taken up annually by phytoplankton is supplied by biological regeneration (including nitrification) in the upper 200 m. Reported discrepancies between estimates of organic C export based on seasonal chemical changes and POC export measured at the BATS site can be almost completely resolved if there is significant regeneration of NO3- via organic-matter decomposition in the upper 200 m. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Modelling multi-nutrient interactions in phytoplankton growth is considered in the context of balancing the level of complexity with the adequacy of output for ammonium, nitrate, P, Si, Fe, temperature and light limitations. Phytoplank- ton submodels for placement in ecosystem simulators should be capable of producing a believable output. This requires not only a realistic growth rate response to limiting nutrients but also a realistic consumption of non' or lesser limiting nutrients. The Monod structure, and allies, fails these requirements. The complexity of the Droop version of the quota model is not matched by flexibility, especially for the description of Si assimilation. A normalised version of the Caperon-Meyer quota model is a better (and no more expensive) structure that, by the addition of a feedback controlled uptake equation and a Monod-type Si assimilation control, gives considerable flexibility at reasonable computational cost. Once the step is taken to include one complex mechanistic component there is considerable advantage to be gained from adding further mechanistic structures with little more cost in integration time. This is especially so for light-iron interactions. Overly simplistic models should not be used just because they offer advantages in computational costs at the expense of realism, even if they give satisfactory fits to a particular data set, as output is more likely to be erroneous in ‘what-if' scenarios and also during simulation of data-poor periods of extant data series.},

abstract = {To consider the relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) content and phytoplankton growth and nutrient status, four phytoplankton species were grown in nitrogen (N)-limited [and, for one species, phosphorus (P)-limited] culture and measurements were made of CNP biomass, in vivo and in vitro Chl a content, the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (FV/FM) and the performance index for photosynthesis, PIABS (a derivative of the O-J-I-P analysis of photosystem II functionality). Interspecies differences plus the development of intraspecies differences during nutrient stress produced c. 10-fold variations in Chl : C. Estimates of C from in vivo Chl content were better than those from extracted Chl content, as the decline in Chl : C during nutrient stress was offset in part by increased Chl fluorescence. FV/FM was not a robust indicator of nutrient status or relative growth rate. Responses of FV/FM in cells re-fed the limiting nutrient showed no consistent pattern with which to gauge nutrient status. PIABS showed some promise as an indicator of nutrient status and relative growth rate. Chl a content and fluorescence parameters do not deserve the unquestioned status they usually enjoy as indicators of biomass and physiological status.},
