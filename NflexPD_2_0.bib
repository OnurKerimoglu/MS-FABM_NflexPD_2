abstract = {Marine plankton elemental stoichiometric ratios can deviate from the Red-field ratio (106C:16N:1P); here, we examine physiological and biogeochem-ical mechanisms that lead to the observed variation across lineages, regions, and seasons. Many models of ecological stoichiometry blend together ac-climative and adaptive responses to environmental conditions. These two pathways can have unique molecular mechanisms and stoichiometric outcomes , and we attempt to disentangle the two processes. We find that interactions between environmental conditions and cellular growth are key to understanding stoichiometric regulation, but the growth rates of most marine plankton populations are poorly constrained. We propose that specific physiological mechanisms have a strong impact on plankton and community stoichiometry in nutrient-rich environments, whereas biogeochemical interactions are important for the stoichiometry of the oligotrophic gyres. Finally, we outline key areas with missing information that is needed to advance understanding of the present and future ecological stoichiometry of ocean plankton.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure is key for the ecology and biogeochemistry of pelagic ecosystems, but the relationship between cell size and maximum growth rate ($\mu$(max) ) is not yet well understood. We used cultures of 22 species of marine phytoplankton from five phyla, ranging from 0.1 to 10(6) $\mu$m(3) in cell volume (V(cell) ), to determine experimentally the size dependence of growth, metabolic rate, elemental stoichiometry and nutrient uptake. We show that both $\mu$(max) and carbon-specific photosynthesis peak at intermediate cell sizes. Maximum nitrogen uptake rate (V(maxN) ) scales isometrically with V(cell) , whereas nitrogen minimum quota scales as V(cell) (0.84) . Large cells thus possess high ability to take up nitrogen, relative to their requirements, and large storage capacity, but their growth is limited by the conversion of nutrients into biomass. Small species show similar volume-specific V(maxN) compared to their larger counterparts, but have higher nitrogen requirements. We suggest that the unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from taxon-independent, size-related constraints in nutrient uptake, requirement and assimilation.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the consequences of accounting for variable Chl:C (chlorophyll:carbon) and C:N (carbon:nitrogen) ratios in the formulation of phytoplankton growth in biogeochemical models. We compare the qualitative behavior of a suite of phytoplankton growth formulations with increasing complexity: 1) a Redfield formulation (constant C:N ratio) without photo-acclimation (constant Chl:C ratio), 2) a Redfield formulation with diagnostic chlorophyll (variable and empirical Chl:C ratio), 3) a quota formulation (variable C:N ratio) with diagnostic chlorophyll, and 4) a quota formulation with prognostic chlorophyll (dynamic variable). These phytoplankton growth formulations are embedded in a simple marine ecosystem model in a 1D framework at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) station. The model parameters are tuned using a stochastic assimilation method (micro-genetic algorithm) and skill assessment techniques are used to compare results. The lowest misfits with observations are obtained when photo-acclimation is taken into account (variable Chl:C ratio) and with non-Redfield stoichiometry (variable C:N ratio), both under spring and summer conditions. This indicates that the most flexible models (i.e., with variable ratios) are necessary to reproduce observations. As seen previously, photo-acclimation is essential in reproducing the observed deep chlorophyll maximum and subsurface production present during summer. Although Redfield and quota formulations of C:N ratios can equally reproduce chlorophyll data the higher primary production that arises from the quota model is in better agreement with observations. Under the oligotrophic conditions that typify the BATS site no clear difference was detected between quota formulations with diagnostic or prognostic chlorophyll. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Fulton2003,
abstract = {Ecosystem rather than species management has become an explicit part of policies that feature in international treaties and national legislation. Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that there is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and that there are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives some insight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management, and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether some models can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendation is that the use of a single 'ultimate' ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatory use of multiple 'minimum-realistic' models is strongly recommended.},

@article{Lenton2007,
abstract = {We re-examine what controls the deep ocean N:P ratio in the light of recent findings that the C:N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton varies with growth rate, nutrient and light limitation, species and phylum, and that N-2-fixation may be limited by Fe, temperature and/or light in large parts of the world ocean. In particular, we assess whether a systematic change in phytoplankton stoichiometry can alter the deep ocean N:P ratio. To do this we adapt recent models to include non-Redfieldian stoichiometry of phytoplankton and restriction of N-2-fixers to a fraction of the surface ocean. We show that a systematic change in phytoplankton C:N:P can alter the concentrations of NO3 and PO4 in the deep ocean but cannot greatly alter their ratio, unless it also alters the N: P threshold for N-2-fixation. This occurs if competitive dynamics set the N:P threshold for N-2-fixation, in which case it remains close to the N: P requirement of non-fixers (rather than that of N-2-fixers) and consequently so does the deep ocean N:P ratio. Then, even if N-2-fixers are restricted to a fraction of the surface ocean, they reach higher densities there, minimising variations in deep ocean N: P. Theoretical limits on the N:P requirements of phytoplankton suggest that whilst the deep ocean has been well oxygenated (i.e. since the Neoproterozoic, with the possible exception of Oceanic Anoxic Events), its N:P ratio is unlikely to have varied by more than a factor of two in either direction. Within these bounds, evolutionary changes in phytoplankton composition, and increased phosphorus weathering due to the biological colonisation of the land surface, are predicted to have driven long-term changes in ocean composition.},

abstract = {Biodiversity of phytoplankton is important for ecosystem stability and marine biogeochemistry. However, the large-scale patterns of diversity are not well understood and are often poorly characterized in terms of statistical relationships with factors such as latitude, temperature and productivity. Here we use ecological theory and a global traitbased ecosystem model to provide mechanistic understanding of patterns of phytoplankton diversity. Our study suggests that phytoplankton diversity across three dimensions of trait space (size, biogeochemical function and thermal tolerance) is controlled by disparate combinations of drivers: the supply rate of the limiting resource, the imbalance in different resource supplies relative to competing phytoplankton demands, size-selective grazing and transport by the moving ocean. Using sensitivity studies we show that each dimension of diversity is controlled by different drivers. Models including only one (or two) of the trait dimensions will have different patterns of diversity than one which incorporates another trait dimension. We use the results of our model exploration to infer the controls on the diversity patterns derived from ﬁeld observations along meridional transects in the Atlantic and to explain why different taxa and size classes have differing patterns.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in projections of marine biogeochemistry from Earth system models (ESMs) are associated to a large degree with the imperfect representation of the marine plankton ecosystem, in particular the physiology of primary and secondary producers. Here, we describe the implementation of an optimality-based plankton-ecosystem model (OPEM) version 1.1 with variable carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus (C: N: P) stoichiometry in the University of Victoria ESM (UVic; Eby et al., 2009; Weaver et al., 2001) and the behaviour of two calibrated reference configurations, which differ in the assumed temperature dependence of diazotrophs. Predicted tracer distributions of oxygen and dissolved inorganic nutrients are similar to those of an earlier fixed-stoichiometry formulation in UVic (Nickelsen et al., 2015). Compared to the classic fixed-stoichiometry UVic model, OPEM is closer to recent satellite-based estimates of net community production (NCP), despite overestimating net primary production (NPP), can better reproduce deep-ocean gradients in the NO−3 : PO34− ratio and partially explains observed patterns of particulate C: N: P in the surface ocean. Allowing diazotrophs to grow (but not necessarily fix N2) at similar temperatures as other phytoplankton results in a better representation of surface Chl and NPP in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Deficiencies of our calibrated OPEM configurations may serve as a magnifying glass for shortcomings in global biogeochemical models and hence guide future model development. The overestimation of NPP at low latitudes indicates the need for improved representations of temperature effects on biotic processes, as well as phytoplankton community composition, which may be represented by locally varying parameters based on suitable trade-offs. The similarity in the overestimation of NPP and surface autotrophic particulate organic carbon (POC) could indicate deficiencies in the representation of top-down control or nutrient supply to the surface ocean. Discrepancies between observed and predicted vertical gradients in particulate C: N: P ratios suggest the need to include preferential P remineralisation, which could also benefit the representation of N2 fixation. While OPEM yields a much improved distribution of surface N* (NO−3 − 16 {\textperiodcentered} PO34− + 2.9 mmol m−3), it still fails to reproduce observed N* in the Arctic, possibly related to a misrepresentation of the phytoplankton community there and the lack of benthic denitrification in the model. Coexisting ordinary and diazotrophic phytoplankton can exert strong control on N* in our simulations, which questions the interpretation of N* as reflecting the balance of N2 fixation and denitrification.},

abstract = {To increase the efficiency of computing phytoplankton growth rate ($\mu$), chlorophyll-to-carbon ($\theta$) and nitrogen-to-carbon ratios (QN) in three-dimensional ocean circulation models, it is preferable to directly calculate $\theta$ and QNfrom ambient environmental factors instead of treating them as independent tracers. Optimality-based modeling has emerged as a novel and efficient approach to fulfill this task. However, it is still unclear precisely how the response of optimality-based models differs from conventional models. We compare a recent optimality-based phytoplankton model (PAHLOW model), based on which the familiar Droop function can be derived, to a commonly used Monod-type (MONOD) model. The two models generate similar patterns of $\mu$ with some important differences. Compared to the MONOD model, the PAHLOW model predicts higher $\mu$ under light limitation. The PAHLOW model also predicts that $\theta$ decreases with decreasing light under dim light and predicts decreasing QNwith increasing light even at constant nutrient levels. Compared to the MONOD model, these features of the PAHLOW model qualitatively agree better with laboratory data. The PAHLOW model also suffers from a few shortcomings including the underestimation of $\theta$ under very low light and two times of computation time compared to the MONOD model. The two models generate striking differences of QNand $\theta$ in a one-dimensional implementation. Validation of such patterns will require more direct in situ measurements of $\mu$, $\theta$ and QN.},

@article{Burson2016,
abstract = {Measures to reduce eutrophication have often led to a more effective decline of phosphorus (P) than nitro- gen (N) concentrations. The resultant changes in riverine nutrient loads can cause an increase in the N : P ratios of coastal waters. During four research cruises along a 450 km transect, we investigated how reductions in nutrient inputs during the past 25 yr have affected nutrient limitation patterns in the North Sea. This revealed a strong offshore gradient of dissolved inorganic N : P ratios in spring, from 375 : 1 nearshore toward 1 : 1 in the central North Sea. This gradient was reflected in high nearshore N : P and C : P ratios of particulate organic matter (mainly phytoplankton), indicative of severe P deficiency of coastal phytoplank- ton, which may negatively affect higher trophic levels in the food web. Nutrient enrichment bioassays per- formed on-board showed P and Si limitation of phytoplankton growth nearshore, co-limitation of N and P in a transitional region, and N limitation in the outer-shore waters, confirming the existence of an offshore gra- dient from P to N limitation. Different species were limited by different nutrients, indicating that further reductions of P loads without concomitant reductions of N loads will suppress colonial Phaeocystis blooms, but will be less effective in diminishing harmful algal blooms by dino- and nanoflagellates. Hence, our results provide evidence that de-eutrophication efforts in northwestern Europe have led to a large imbalance in the N : P stoichiometry of coastal waters of the North Sea, with major consequences for the growth, species com- position, and nutritional quality of marine phytoplankton communities.

@article{Garcia2016,
abstract = {The factors that control elemental ratios within phytoplankton, like carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P), are key to biogeochemical cycles. Previous studies have identified relationships between nutrient-limited growth and elemental ratios in large eukaryotes, but little is known about these interactions in small marine phytoplankton like the globally important Cyanobacteria. To improve our understanding of these interactions in picophytoplankton, we asked how cellular elemental stoichiometry varies as a function of steady-state, N- and P-limited growth in laboratory chemostat cultures of Synechococcus WH8102. By combining empirical data and theoretical modeling, we identified a previously unrecognized factor (growth-dependent variability in cell size) that controls the relationship between nutrient-limited growth and cellular elemental stoichiometry. To predict the cellular elemental stoichiometry of phytoplankton, previous theoretical models rely on the traditional Droop model, which purports that the acquisition of a single limiting nutrient suffices to explain the relationship between a cellular nutrient quota and growth rate. Our study, however, indicates that growth-dependent changes in cell size have an important role in regulating cell nutrient quotas. This key ingredient, along with nutrient-uptake protein regulation, enables our model to predict the cellular elemental stoichiometry of Synechococcus across a range of nutrient-limited conditions. Our analysis also adds to the growth rate hypothesis, suggesting that P-rich biomolecules other than nucleic acids are important drivers of stoichiometric variability in Synechococcus. Lastly, by comparing our data with field observations, our study has important ecological relevance as it provides a framework for understanding and predicting elemental ratios in ocean regions where small phytoplankton like Synechococcus dominates.},

@article{Inomura2020,
abstract = {We present a model of the growth rate and elemental stoichiometry of phytoplankton as a function of resource allocation between and within broad macromolecular pools under a variety of resource supply conditions. The model is based on four, empirically-supported, cornerstone assumptions: that there is a saturating relationship between light and photosynthesis, a linear relationship between RNA/protein and growth rate, a linear relationship between biosynthetic proteins and growth rate, and a constant macromolecular composition of the light-harvesting machinery. We combine these assumptions with statements of conservation of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and energy. The model can be solved algebraically for steady state conditions and constrained with data on elemental stoichiometry from published laboratory chemostat studies. It interprets the relationships between macromolecular and elemental stoichiometry and also provides quantitative predictions of the maximum growth rate at given light intensity and nutrient supply rates. The model is compatible with data sets from several laboratory studies characterizing both prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton from marine and freshwater environments. It is conceptually simple, yet mechanistic and quantitative. Here, the model is constrained only by elemental stoichiometry, but makes predictions about allocation to measurable macromolecular pools, which could be tested in the laboratory.},

abstract = {A modelling system for coupled physicalbiogeochemical simulations in the water column is presented here. The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple NPZ to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},
